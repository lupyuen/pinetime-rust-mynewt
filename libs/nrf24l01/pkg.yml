# Initialisation functions to be called by sysinit() during startup.
# Mynewt consolidates the initialisation functions into sysinit()
# and calls them according to the Stage number, highest number first.
# Stage 500 is used by Sensor Creator so we use Stage 600 onwards.
# Generated sysinit(): bin/targets/bluepill_my_sensor/generated/src/bluepill_my_sensor-sysinit-app.c

pkg.init:
    # nrf24l01 should be initialised after sensor_network (Stage 640)
    nrf24l01_create: 650  # Call nrf24l01_create() to initialise the nRF24L01 driver during startup
